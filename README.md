# Voice Assistant

The Voice Assistant is a Python-based software application that leverages the power of the Speech Recognition Module and SAPI (Speech Application Programming Interface) to streamline email management, call handling, and user queries. It enables voice-based commands and interactions, providing an efficient and productive user experience.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition:** The Voice Assistant utilizes the Speech Recognition Module to convert spoken commands into text, enabling users to interact with the application using their voice.
- **Email Management:** Users can dictate and send emails through voice commands. The Voice Assistant transcribes the spoken email content into text and handles the email sending process.
- **Call Handling:** The Voice Assistant can initiate phone calls by recognizing the desired contact name or number through voice input. It uses the SAPI interface to make the necessary phone calls.
- **User Queries:** Users can ask the Voice Assistant various questions or request information on specific topics. The application uses natural language processing to understand the queries and provides relevant responses.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Voice Assistant, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Speech Recognition Module: Install the Speech Recognition module using `pip install SpeechRecognition`.
- SAPI (Speech Application Programming Interface): Ensure that the SAPI interface is installed and configured correctly on your operating system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code for the Voice Assistant.

2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the Prerequisites section.

3. Run the `voice_assistant.py` script to start the application.

4. Once the application is running, it will listen for voice commands. You can give commands for email management, call handling, or ask questions based on the available features.

5. Speak clearly and wait for the Voice Assistant to process your command. The application will provide feedback or perform the requested action accordingly.

6. To exit the Voice Assistant, you can use a predefined voice command or press the designated exit key.

## Configuration

Some aspects of the Voice Assistant can be customized based on your preferences or requirements. Open the `config.py` file to modify the following settings:

- **Email Configuration:** Specify the SMTP server details (such as host, port, username, and password) to enable email sending functionality through the Voice Assistant.

- **SAPI Configuration:** Set up the necessary configurations for the SAPI interface, including voice recognition settings, supported languages, and speech synthesis options.

## Limitations

- The Voice Assistant heavily relies on accurate speech recognition. In case of background noise or unclear pronunciation, the recognition accuracy may vary.

- The email management functionality requires valid SMTP server details for email sending. Make sure to provide correct and authorized credentials.

- Call handling relies on the SAPI interface and may be subject to the limitations or restrictions imposed by the operating system or the telephony service provider.
